HyGen CMS
=========

The HyGen Communication Management System, or CMS, is controlled by
this Python package, running on a BeagleBone Black or BeagleBone Black
clone such as the one manufactured by Arrow. It is intended to function
on the Linux kernel version 4.1+, as 4.1 introduced a number of changes
to the kernel interface file structure, and supports the Arrow
BeagleBone Black Industrial on the same image as other BeagleBone Black
devices.

Dependencies
------------

This software relies on a number of other pieces of software. The most
prominent among them is Python. While an effort has been made to keep
the software compatible between Python 2 and Python 3, it is
recommended to use Python 3, as it is perfectly stable, and is the
platform being used for development.

Within Python, there are several dependencies, which are best installed
with ``pip``. These are listed in the ``dependencies.txt`` file in the
top level of this repository.

Apart from these tools, the program relies on several shell commands to
be installed and present in the root PATH:

- ``pmount``
- ``pumount``
- ``lsblk``
- ``mount``
