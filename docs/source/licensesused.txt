Licenses used
=============

The HyGen CMS software uses several open source projects. This
page keeps track of each, and what license it is used under.
A simple summary of the licenses listed here (with the exception
of the Python license) can be found
`here <http://choosealicense.com/appendix/`_. None of these
licenses imposes any burden, beyond including the license and
notice of copyright along with any distribution of the code.
Our own code can be maintained under our "all rights reserved"
license.

- pyserial: BSD license
- python: python license (specific to python, very permissive)
- code from StackOverflow: MIT License
- modbus_tk: LGPL license
- monotonic: apache license
